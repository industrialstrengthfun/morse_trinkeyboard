Purpose:  USB Morse Code Keyboard

Summary:  Using Adafruit's TRRS Trinkey for Adaptive Access a Morse Code paddle (single or double) plugs in via TRS and acts as a keyboard.

Interesting notes:
1)  I added an SMD piezo to the Ring2 and Sleeve solder pads so that it can play a sidetone
2)  Had to add various usability characters like "space", "return" and backspace(prosign - error).

TODO:

0)  Add profile code
1)  Sometimes lags on DAH to DIT performance.
2)  Document additional features
3)  Link to webpage from industrialstrengthfun.com
